# Flask-Py2Neo

Flask-Py2Neo is mostly a connection utility. The aim is to get you up and running as quickly as possible. It also aims to use best-practices in terms of how the connection is made between `py2neo` and your Neo4j instance.

## Quickstart

Here is a quickstart guide. It shows how to initialize and make use of the extension.

To initialize in an application module:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_py2neo import Py2Neo

app = Flask(__name__)
db = Py2Neo(app)
```

Or this pattern:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_py2neo import Py2Neo

app = Flask(__name__)
db = Py2Neo()
db.init_app(app)
```

Then define some view functions:

```python
@app.route('/create/<string:name>')
def create(name):
    db.graph.run("CREATE (n:User {name: '%s'})" % name) # noqa
    return jsonify('user %s created' % name)

@app.route('/list/')
def list():
    return jsonify(db.graph.run("MATCH (n:User) RETURN n").data())
```

## Object-Graph Mapper

```python
from py2neo.ogm import GraphObject, Property

class Post(GraphObject):

    title = Property()

post = Post()
post.title = 'my first post'

db.graph.push(post)
```
